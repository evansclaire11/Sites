                <h2 data-aos="fade-right">What is Our Mission?</h2>
                <p>The Sustainable By Design Conference aims to define sustainable design, understanding that
                    sustainability pertains to the environment, social welfare, and economic welfare. We will reevaluate
                    current design practices in the context of our ourselves, our communities, and the natural world. We
                    hope to address pressing issues related to the way in which our world is currently heading and offer
                    practical design solutions and goals to change our path towards a more sustainable one. This
                    conference will also allow us to open up a dialogue and work together to find better solutions in
                    making the design world, and the rest of the world, more sustainable. </p>

            <div class="right-column">
                <h2 data-aos="fade-left"> Who should come?</h2>
                <p>Of course, anyone is welcome to come and learn sustainabile design if that if your passion. We
                    believe every designer should be informed about sustainability, and the cost of our actions if we
                    continue designing in the way we design now. Sustainanbility should be on every designer's mind
                    before they begin a project whether you are a graphic designer, fashion designer, or a product
                    designer; it's all
                    relevant. It is also important to hear from a variety of practicers and perspectives from every
                    field, because believe it or not, a lot of fields of design are interconnected; it is important
                    to learn about their practices moving forward in the age of our ever changing climate and
                    economy.</p>

                <li>Founder of the fully solar powered website running from a
                    server on the roof of his apartment in Barcelona. The solar panel
                    powers the battery to the server, and there is an icon on the site
                    that shows users how much energy is left in the battery. This
                    website has about 3 days a month where it actually shuts off
                    because of the nature of solar power. This is a recent innovation,
                    and has been widely talked about recently.

                        future of our capitalist economy. How our capitalist economy
                        got to be where it is today, what will need to change, how will
                        we have to adapt, what we we do now. Michael will look more
                        closely at the cost of our choices today, and where that will lead
                        if nothing is to change. He will also look at real examples of
                        product design that either unsuccessfully or successfully became
                        sustainable.</p>

                    <p class="schedule-title">Talk: Ecotech Myths and Lessons from the Past</p>
                    <p>The present-day approach towards a sustainable society is doomed to fail. The focus on
                        sophisticated technology – electric and hybrid cars, energy-efficient devices, solar panels and
                        wind turbines, for instance – has little or no effect because these green technologies require
                        large amounts of energy and resources for their manufacture, which makes their development
                        highly dependent on a continuous supply of fossil fuels. What we need to solve our problems is
                        exactly the opposite: less sophisticated technology. There is a lot to learn from the past.
                        While they often worked surprisingly good, most of low-tech solutions have been completely
                        forgotten. In his speech, Kris de Decker explains that reverting to past technologies does not
                        mean that we should go back to the Middle Ages. Rather, it means combining old tech with new
                        knowledge and new materials, or applying old concepts and lost knowledge to modern technology.
