                <h3>What is Our Mission?</h3>
                <p>The Sustainable By Design Conference aims to define sustainable design, understanding that
                    sustainability pertains to the environment, social welfare, and economic welfare. We will reevaluate
                    current design practices in the context of our ourselves, our communities, and the natural world. We
                    hope to address pressing issues related to the way in which our world is currently heading and offer
                    practical design solutions and goals to change our path towards a more sustainable one. This
                    conference will also allow us to open up a dialogue and work together to find better solutions in
                    making the design world, and the rest of the world, more sustainable. </p>

                <h3> What Is our Mission?</h3>
                <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                    industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
                    and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
                    leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
                    with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
                    publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

                <li>Executive Director at New Standard Instiute</li>
                <li>Founder and director of the New Standard Institute. She
                    co-founded the fashion brand, Zady, focusing on sustainable
                    practices with the best materials, low environmental footprints,
                    fair labor, and style. Zady was named of the world’s “Most Innovative
                    Companies” in retail.</li>

                <li>Freelance Journalist & Creator of Low-Tech Magazine</li>
                <li>Founder of the fully solar powered website running from a
                    server on the roof of his apartment in Barcelona. The solar panel
                    powers the battery to the server, and there is an icon on the site
                    that shows users how much energy is left in the battery. This
                    website has about 3 days a month where it actually shuts off
                    because of the nature of solar power. This is a recent innovation,
                    and has been widely talked about recently.

                <li>Author of the book Cradle to Cradle and The Upcycle: Beyond
                    Sustainability--Designing for Abundance. Michael believes in
                    redesigning industrial production to create a circular economy in
                    which everything being made either gets reused into something
                    else or goes back into the earth. They believe this is the way
                    designers need to work in the future in order to keep humanity
                    alive.</li>

                    <li>Michael Braungart will give us a new goal to imagine for the
                        future of our capitalist economy. How our capitalist economy
                        got to be where it is today, what will need to change, how will
                        we have to adapt, what we we do now. Michael will look more
                        closely at the cost of our choices today, and where that will lead
                        if nothing is to change. He will also look at real examples of
                        product design that either unsuccessfully or successfully became
                        sustainable.</li>

                        negatively impacts ourselves, workers, and the environment.
                        Looking at her personal story, company, and current practices,
                        she will explore what a more sustainable fashion culture would
                        look like and how companies and people alike will have to
                        change their attitude and behavior to meet these standards.</li>

                        media, webdesign, logos, package design, and more can become
                        more sustainable? We will also look more philosophically at our
                        design practices to see where we can reduce and question what
                        projects and design practices are worth exploring in helping
                        sustain the earth’s natural world. In addition, we will examine
