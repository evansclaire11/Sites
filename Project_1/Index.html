        To demonstrate how smart an octopus can be, Piero Amodio points to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DoWdHOtlrk"><cite>YouTube
                video</cite></a>. It shows an octopus pulling two halves of a coconut shell together to hide inside.
        Later the animal stacks the shells together like nesting bowls — and carts them away.</p>

        <q cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/science/animal-intelligence-octopus-cephalopods.html">It suggests
            the octopus is carrying these tools around because it has some understanding they may be useful in the
            future,</q> said Mr. Amodio, a graduate student studying animal intelligence at the University of Cambridge
        in Britain.

    <p>
        But his amazement is mixed with puzzlement.

        For decades, researchers have studied how certain animals evolved to be intelligent, among them apes,
        elephants,
        dolphins and even some birds, such as crows and parrots.
    </p>

    <p>But all the scientific theories fail when it comes to cephalopods, a group that includes octopuses, squid and
        cuttlefish. Despite feats of creativity, they lack some hallmarks of intelligence seen in other species.</p>

    <p><q cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/science/animal-intelligence-octopus-cephalopods.html">It’s an
            apparent paradox that’s been largely overlooked in the past,</q> said Mr. Amodio. He and five other experts
        on animal intelligence explore this paradox in a paper published this month in the journal Trends in Ecology
        and Evolution.</p>

    <p>For scientists who study animal behavior, intelligence is not about acing a calculus test or taking a car apart
        and putting it back together. Intelligence comprises sophisticated cognitive skills that help an animal thrive.</p>

    <p>That may include the ability to come up with solutions to the problem of finding food, for example, or a knack
        for planning for some challenge in the future. Intelligent animals don’t rely on fixed responses to survive —
        they can invent new behaviors on the fly.</p>

    <p>To measure animal intelligence, scientists observe creatures in the wild — watching a dolphin stick a sponge on
        its beak to avoid getting cuts from sharp rocks and coral, for example. Or they bring animals into the lab and
        offer them puzzles to solve, such as rewarding crows when they learn to rip paper into strips of just the right
        size.</p>

    <p>Only a few species stand out in these studies, and by comparing them, scientists have identified some shared
        factors. The animals have big brains relative to their body size, they live for a long time, and they can form
        long-lasting social bonds.</p>

    <p>Those similarities have led to some promising explanations for how certain animals evolved to be smart.</p>

    <p>One is known as the ecological intelligence hypothesis. It holds that intelligence evolves as an adaptation for
        finding food. While some animals have a reliable food supply, others have to cope with unpredictability.</p>

    <p>“If you eat fruit, you have to remember where the fruiting trees are and when they’re ripe,” said Mr. Amadio.
        “It can be much more cognitively challenging than eating leaves.”</p>

    <p>Tools allow animals to get to food that they couldn’t reach otherwise. And if they can make plans for the
        future, they can store food to survive hard times.</p>

    <p>Other researchers have argued for what’s known as the social intelligence hypothesis: Smarter animals “cooperate
        and learn from other members of the same species,” said Mr. Amadio.</p>

    <p>Together, these forces appear to have encouraged the development of bigger, more powerful brains.</p>

    <p>Smart animals also tend to live for a long time, and it’s possible that bigger brains drove the evolution of
        longevity. It takes years for juveniles to develop these complex organs, during which time they need help from
        adults to get enough food.</p>

    <p>Cephalopods behave in ways that certainly suggest they’re highly intelligent. An octopus named Inky, for
        example, made a notorious escape recently from the National Aquarium of New Zealand, exiting his enclosure and
        slithering into a floor drain and, apparently, out to sea.</p>

    <p>Cuttlefish can scare off predators by forming eyespots on their bodies in order to look like giant fish. But
        they only use this trick against predators that rely on vision to find prey. If a predator that depends on
        smell shows up, the cuttlefish are smart enough just to flee.</p>
